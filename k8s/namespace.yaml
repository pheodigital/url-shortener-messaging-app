# ─── Namespace ────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# What is a namespace?
#   A namespace is like a separate room inside your Kubernetes cluster.
#   Everything for our app lives in the "url-shortener" room.
#   This keeps our app isolated from other apps on the same cluster.
#
# Real world analogy:
#   A office building has many companies (namespaces)
#   Each company has its own floor (namespace)
#   They share the building (cluster) but do not interfere with each other
#
# How to apply:
#   kubectl apply -f k8s/namespace.yaml
